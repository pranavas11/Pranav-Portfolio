    ## Questions
    **Tell me about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.**
    - Since a young age, I’ve always had a knack for tutoring and teaching others and sharing knowledge. During my senior year at Virginia Tech, I found myself juggling way too many responsibilities—coursework, a part-time job, student clubs, and launching a student-led tutoring service. The traditional campus tutoring model was very slow and pretty inefficient, especially for higher level Computer Science courses which only had a few UTAs or GTAs. So instead of starting from scratch, I decided to “hack” the system that was already in place: student clubs. I pitched my tutoring service as an official initiative under a few academic clubs like the Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) club and VTHacks, which meant I could skip the long process of getting separate approval and funding from the university. This let me use their room bookings, mailing lists, and campus credibility to gain traction quickly. Once inside the system, I didn’t just rely on their structure—I improved it. I reworked the club’s communication channels to include an instant tutoring request feature for one-on-one help, scheduled regular sessions using Google Forms and Sheets (way faster than seeking TA office hours through Canvas), and even started a peer-to-peer referral chain using word-of-mouth incentives. Within four weeks, we had tripled our reach compared to the campus center, and we were running sessions in dorm lounges and cafés rather than official buildings, which made the whole experience feel less intimidating and more human. What made this feel like a real hack wasn’t just that it saved time—it was the mindset shift. I learned that you don’t always have to rely on the few UTAs or GTAs who have never taken the courses before to get help, but rather a network of like-minded individuals who have the knowledge are able to share their thoughts and offer feedback to newbies. I also learned that you don’t always have to build something from the ground up to make a difference as even my current startup project also demonstrates. Sometimes, we just have to rewire what’s already there and plug into the right circuits.

    **List any entrepreneurship programs, clubs, or hacker houses you have participated in or are currently participating in.**
    - During my time at Virginia Tech, I immersed myself deeply in the campus's tech and entrepreneurship communities. In my sophomore year, I served as Vice President of the Data Structures & Algorithms Club, where I helped run problem-solving sessions and mentorship programs for students preparing for internships and technical interviews. By junior year, I took on the role of President of VTHacks, the university’s official Hackathon organization. Leading this club gave me first-hand experience organizing large-scale events, managing sponsorships, and supporting hundreds of student hackers—from ideation to demo day. I was also a member of the Cybersecurity Club, where I explored ethical hacking, CTFs, and practical applications of secure coding. Outside of school, I’ve continued growing through the DC Tech Meetup group, where I connect regularly with founders, engineers, and civic-minded technologists. I’m also actively involved in Civic Tech DC, a volunteer-driven organization focused on building open-source tools that support democracy and community initiatives. One of the most meaningful projects I’ve contributed to is the Electrify DMV initiative—an easy-to-use contractor finder tool that helps homeowners decarbonize their homes. The tool tackles a real barrier to climate action by connecting people to sustainable contractors, sharing rebate info, and unlocking training and workforce resources through IRA funding. I’ve been involved in the technical side of things—helping shape its data models, user flows, and long-term scalability.

    **Why did you choose to build this AI portfolio?**
    - I chose to build this AI portfolio because I wanted to create an interactive and engaging way for people to learn about my skills, projects, and experiences. Traditional portfolios can be static and boring, but with an AI-powered portfolio, I can provide personalized responses and insights based on user queries. It allows me to showcase my work in a more dynamic way and make it easier for potential employers or collaborators to connect with me. Plus, it’s a fun way to demonstrate my passion for AI and technology!

    **Tell me about a time you failed or overcame a challenge.**
    - One of the biggest challenges I faced was during my final year at Virginia Tech when I was balancing a full course load, a part-time job, and leading VTHacks. I was also working on my senior capstone project, which involved building a complex web application. As the deadline approached, I found myself overwhelmed and struggling to keep up with everything. I realized that I needed to prioritize and manage my time better. I started using project management tools like Trello to break down tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and set realistic deadlines for each one. I also reached out to my professors and peers for support and advice. By focusing on one task at a time and staying organized, I was able to complete my project on time and even received positive feedback from my professors. This experience taught me the importance of time management, seeking help when needed, and staying focused on my goals.

    **Lonewolf or team player?**
    - I consider myself a team player. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can share ideas, learn from others, and contribute to a common goal. I believe that diverse perspectives lead to better solutions, and I enjoy working with people who bring different skills and experiences to the table. However, I also value the ability to work independently when needed, especially when it comes to deep focus tasks or personal projects. Ultimately, I think a balance of both is essential for success.

    **What new skills have you learned recently, and how did you go about learning them?**
    - Recently, I’ve been diving deep into AI and machine learning, particularly in the context of building intelligent applications. I started by taking online courses on platforms like Coursera and edX, focusing on topics like natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. I also joined online communities and forums where I could engage with other learners and professionals in the field. Additionally, I’ve been working on personal projects that apply these concepts, such as developing a chatbot using OpenAI’s GPT models and building a recommendation system for a web application. This hands-on experience has been invaluable in solidifying my understanding and skills.

    **WWhat is your favorite programming language and why?**
    - My favorite programming language is Python. I love its simplicity and readability, which makes it easy to write and understand code. Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that make it incredibly versatile for various applications, from web development to data analysis and machine learning. I also appreciate the strong community support and the abundance of resources available for learning and troubleshooting. Overall, Python allows me to be productive and creative in my projects.

    **What’s a hobby or interest that helps you recharge outside of work?**
    - One of my favorite hobbies is working out and staying active. I find that regular exercise helps me clear my mind, reduce stress, and boost my overall mood. Whether it’s hitting the gym, going for a run, or playing sports with friends, physical activity is a great way for me to recharge. I also enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and biking, which allow me to connect with nature and explore new places. These hobbies not only keep me fit but also provide a much-needed break from the screen and help me maintain a healthy work-life balance. I also enjoy playing Chess.
